                <p><strong>Hey!</strong> Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read about me.</p>

                <h5>Personal:</h5>

                <p>Health and family are what I consider important, and for exercise I like to walk, run and cycle as often as possible.</p>

                <p>I have studied Seven Star Praying Mantis Kung-Fu for many years and I have also travelled to China to further my training.
                It was an amazing experience with training lasting for six hours a day over a 10 day trip. Meeting people from the route of the art and visiting where the original studies took place was an experience I'll never forget and hopefully have the opportunity to do once more at least.</p>

                <p>I'm a gamer too! Not competition level gaming, but I do enjoy a few AAA titles now and again. Tech is definitely a passion of mine, but I also really like steam engines too. It's the appreciation of engineering, thought of design and skill that is put into a build that interests me.</p>

                <h5>Professional:</h5>

                <p>I'm an IT Professional and I have worked in IT for a long time now.
                Mainly working in an IT Infrastructure capacity and then IT Management, I decided to progress and build upon my already obtained knowledge down the Coding & Development path.
                It was by accident that I found I really enjoy coding; I had a task presented to me whereby I was not provided with the required budget or resource to deliver the project in the requested time frame (all too familiar, ehh!).</p>
                
                <p>Anyway I chose to take on the task myself with some guidance from other well establish developers, I found quickly that I enjoyed working with HTML and CSS so much so that I decided this was something I wanted to do as a career choice. However I needed to be able to code competently, because I was finding self teaching extremely challenging, let me tell you!</p>

                <p>With this in mind I enrolled on the 'Full Stack Flex Coding Boot Camp' at the University of Birmingham and I haven't looked back! The course is amazing, I'm being challanged daily and the speed of which I am learning is at such a fast pace.</p>

                <p>Well, I do hope you like my first attempt at a Portfolio Website, and that you do stay tuned for updates with regards to my coding abilities and career progression over the coming months.</p>

                <p>My GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter links are in the footer of this site.</p>

                <p>Take care.</p>
