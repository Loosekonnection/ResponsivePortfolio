WK03 Homework - 02 Responsive Portfolio

## Approach

Following the directions of the provided README file, I whiteboarded a rough outline of the portfolio site I needed to create to meet the homework requirements. This helped me visually identify the `sections`, `containers`, `rows` & `columns` that I needed to create.

*   NAV
*   Banner
*   Main
*   Footer

I then created the following repository on GitLab:

*   homeworkResponsivePortfolio

after cloning the above respository, I created the following files locally and then pushed them to the repo:

*   index.html
*   portfolio.html
*   contact.html

Within each of the local .html files, I created a baseline HTML boilerplate template where I added the Bootstrap CSS and JS links.

I then began to create each of my whiteboard design elements within the index.html file. 

Using Bootraps site I located a suitable NAV that matched my design, I edited this to work within my site and how i wanted it to look.

I then found the Jumbotron to use as a banner.

I was unable to find a suitable footer, so I created it from scratch using Bootstrap classes that I had looked up.

Once I had the main structure I worked to make these elements responsive across all devices, I then copied the code to the other .html files, so the code was consistent across the site.

I next began to work with the main content of each page.

I searched for a contact form online and edited one I found to reflect my requirements and site design.

I then created an `img` directory and chose eight images to create a Portfolio page with. I found the alligment of the portrait and lanscape images difficult to achieve, but this was the design I had chosen to challange myself with.

Using online resources I final found a way to align them and for the alignment to remain throughout responsive changes.

I next created the About Me layout in the index.html and design from scratch.
The responsiveness of the was challanging

After finally being happy with the structure and responsive design I ran the code through an HTML Validator, this identified a few rouge tags that I had to tidy up.

## Findings

The homework focussed on Bootstrap and I was unsure whether I was allowed to use my own CSS styles. The README guide wasn't clear, however it advised to minimise the use of Breakpoints, which is normally in a CSS file I thought.

I tired to build the site without using my own CSS file, I found Bootstrap excellent for speed of creating ellements and sections, but limiting on being able to style them.

I tried to create a fixed footer and while I found it easy to create the fixed footer, I could not figure out how to prevent the `<body>` from being hidden behind the footer unless I created my own CSS file and used a `margin-bottom` on the `<body>` element. This was very challanging!

It would be great to next get the contact form working with an email service.
