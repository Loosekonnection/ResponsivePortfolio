# Portfolio

My portfolio website with a mobile first responsive design in mind.

*   GitHub Repository [responsivePortfolio](https://github.com/Loosekonnection/responsivePortfolio)
*   GitHub Pages URL [Weather Dashboard Webpage](https://loosekonnection.github.io/responsivePortfolio/)
---

<br>

## Summary

My portfolio site is to display a collection of my projects in a single easy to view place. On the site there are links to the site URL's on GitHub and links to the GitHub repositories.

I have setup the contact form to use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), so if you wish to reach out I can be contacted via the webform.

## Next Steps

As I improve in my coding abilities, I will continue to produce and add more projects, and enhance my existing projects in areas I upskill in. I may also integrate some of the projects directly within my portfolio site for use in a single site, while also keeping copy in seperate repositories.
