## Summary

My portfolio site provides a brief summary about me, and then displays a collection of my projects. 

On this site there are links to the site URL's on GitHub and links to the GitHub repositories.

I have setup the contact form that uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), so if you wish to reach out I can be contacted via the webform.

Below is a summary of Tech used and some screen shots of the site, then a list of credits who have bee exetremely helpful throughout my coding journey so far.

## Next Steps

As I improve in my coding abilities: 

I will continue to produce and update the site with more projects.

I will enhance my existing projects in areas I upskill in. 

I may also integrate some of the projects directly within my portfolio.

While also keeping copies in seperate repositories.
